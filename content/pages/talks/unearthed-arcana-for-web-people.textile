Summary: This is one of my favorite talks I've given. I gave it at "Refresh the Triangle":http://www.refreshthetriangle.org in October 2008, and again at "Viget Labs":http://www.viget.com in November 2008. It's a far-ranging talk about my techniques to transform myself from an ADD-plagued procrastinator to a focused person and get more enjoyment out of both work and play.
