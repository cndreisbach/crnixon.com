  I gave this tutorial at RailsConf 2011. The short version: great practices make upgrading easy.

# Migrating Legacy Apps to Rails 3

I gave this tutorial at RailsConf 2011. The slides are quite detailed because I realized that there was no way anyone was going to actually upgrade their app during my talk and that they might want some real notes to be able to reference during their upgrade.
