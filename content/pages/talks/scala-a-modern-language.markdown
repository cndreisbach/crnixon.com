# "Scala: A Modern Language"

> Scala is a language for the Java Virtual Machine that combines the power of Java with the flexibility of a dynamic language and the capabilities of a functional language. We'll explore how Scala can make standard object-oriented programming more concise and powerful, and how it can make concurrency easy and clear. We'll specifically show how these capabilities can be used with languages you might already be using, Java and Ruby.

I gave this talk at [Developer Day](http://developer-day.com/) in Durham, NC. I tried to make it a good introduction to what Scala is and why you might use it. Even more fun, I wrote my slides in Markdown and generated them with my own Scala slideshow-generation application.
