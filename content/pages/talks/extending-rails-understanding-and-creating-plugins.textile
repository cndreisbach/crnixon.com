h1. Extending Rails: Understanding and Creating Plugins

I gave this tutorial talk at O'Reilly's Open Source Conference 2008. It covers a wide area, ranging from how to install Rails plugins to detailed walkthroughs of plugin code. This is a great talk to hear if you want to know more about the internals of Rails or writing extensions for any Ruby library.

The slides are embedded below, but for the full experience, these two videos have the slides, audio, and some live code examples.
